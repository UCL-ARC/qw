Here's a bit of test data

### System requirements

* SYS-REQ-22
* SYS-REQ-115

### Description

This requirement has three main aspects:

1. User experience
  * Making the display look a lot better
  * Animating the *screen*
  * Decreasing the time between **user action** and the result appearing
2. Testability
  * We can remove waits from the _test script_
  * Less *expert* __testers__ can be used
3. Making it easier to sell

And it all comes down to removing a few waits.
